    * Animal.java is the parent class for Cow.java:
    * Write the constructor for Animal.java, initializing name, age, and height variables.
    * Return the name in the getName() method.
    * Return the age in the getAge() method.

    * Cow.java has one additional String method called getSound(), return "Moo!" when this method is called.
    *
    * Farmer John wants two methods in the Barn.java class to keep track of his cows:
    * Return the name of the animal with the longest name in the barn when the 'String getLongestName()' method is called.
    * Return the name of the tallest animal in the barn when the 'String getTallest()' method is called.
    * Additionally, write a method that returns the List<Animals. ArrayList called 'getAnimals()' when called.
